# Platform Notes — Retell

This is your working notes page for the platform you’ll see in client projects.

## Integration checklist
- Where does the system prompt live?
- How do you inject client data (static, dynamic, retrieval)?
- How do tools/actions work?
- How are transcripts exported?
- How do you handle fallbacks/escalation?

## Known risks to watch
- Tool latency causing awkward pauses
- Misrecognition from ASR (speech-to-text) and how it cascades
- Data drift: client updates hours/prices but prompt references old info
- Prompt injection via caller content

Keep this page updated per project.
