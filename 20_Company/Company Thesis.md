# Company Thesis

## One-sentence thesis
We help B2B teams ship **reliable AI agents** by designing and validating prompts + test suites so the agent behaves predictably in production.

## What we do (in plain words)
- Turn client data + business rules into an **agent prompt spec**
- Build a **test harness** (golden tests + adversarial tests)
- Iterate until the agent is **stable** under real-world variation
- Provide **release notes** and regression tests to prevent “prompt drift”

## What we don't do
- We’re not a generic “prompt writing” shop.
- We don’t promise magical AGI—just measurable reliability.
