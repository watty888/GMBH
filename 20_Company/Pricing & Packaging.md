# Pricing & Packaging

Pricing anchors:
- Value of prevented failures (wrong info, missed sales, compliance risk)
- Cost of manual escalations / agent fallbacks
- Cost of engineering time spent chasing prompt regressions

Suggested structure:
- Fixed fee for Audit
- Milestone-based for Build + Validation
- Monthly retainer for ongoing QA

Decision rule:
If you cannot define **metrics** or **failure costs**, you cannot price properly.
