# ICP & Buyer Notes

## Ideal customer profile (ICP)
- Already using or piloting AI voice agents
- Has structured business data (hours, pricing, services, CRM)
- Needs compliance + consistent outcomes

## Buyer roles
- Founder/Owner (SME)
- Ops lead / call center manager
- Head of product (SaaS offering voice agents)

## Buying triggers
- “The agent said something wrong on a live call”
- Too many manual escalations
- Model/provider/tool change broke behavior

## Disqualifiers
- No data access
- No willingness to test / measure outcomes
- Wants “one prompt forever”
